# Hello, I'm Nicolas, welcome to my profile! 👋
I am a software developer living in Italy and I graduated in Computer Science at University of Padua (UniPD) in 2023.
## What am I working on? 💻 👷‍♂️
I am currently doing an internship, where I am able to work on technologies like Go, Python, Scala and also learning some AWS stuff.
## Some things that I am learning: 📚 🌱
- HTMX 👀
- Java
- Go (for work but also because I like it so much!)
## My hobbies and favourites things? ⚡
- I am fan of computers and I like building rigs for me or for my friends (or for whoever sends me an email to do so 😉)
- Tutoring: I recently started this side gig and (surprisingly) I like it a lot! 🤓
- I love cars and motors in general: some legends say that I am able to recognize a car from its lights 👀
- Every kind of sport!
- Travelling wherever and whenever I can 🛫 🧳 🗺️
- The most recent one is photography, and I am starting to dig inside it! 📸
